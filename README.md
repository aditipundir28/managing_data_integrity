<b>MANAGING DATA INTEGRITY EVALUATION AND SEARCH THROUGHOUT ENCRYPTED DATA OVER CLOUD<b>
This project can be used to perform data integrity and search on the data stored over cloud. The proposed method uses the RCC encryption approach and includes preprocessing steps
such as special symbol removal, tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming to reduce
the complexity of the system and enhance the search process. The paper also details the
creation of data buckets, encryption using RCC, and key generation. The approach has been experimentally evaluated, and the results indicate improved
performance. It provides a useful solution for managing cloud data while maintaining
anonymity and data integrity.
